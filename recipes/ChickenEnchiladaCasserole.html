    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>garlic salt to taste</li>
        <li>18 (6 inch) corn tortillas, torn in half</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can green chile enchilada sauce</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container reduced fat sour cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish.</li>
        <li>Season chicken with garlic salt; arrange in the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink and juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cool, shred, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, char each tortilla half over the open flame of a gas stove burner using metal tongs until lightly puffed, about 1 minute.e</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/2 inch enchilada sauce into the bottom of a medium baking dish; arrange 6 tortillas in a single layer on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with 1/2 of the chicken, 1/3 of the cheese, 1/2 of the sour cream, and 1/3 of the remaining enchilada sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers. Coat remaining tortillas thoroughly with some of the remaining enchilada sauce and arrange on top. Sprinkle with remaining cheese and top with any remaining enchilada sauce.</li>
        <li>Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Cool slightly before serving.</li>
    </ol>
